If you want high quality sports equipment or clothes, you go to a shop that specialises in it. If you want really good shoes, you go to a shoe shop. No where but a tabletop shop and large online retailers like amazon will sell D&D stuff. And cheap plastic toy yoyos from normal shops are really bad.

Will I use it in my games? If there's barely anything in it for its price, or I don't think it'll get used, it's not a good purchase. For yoyos its hard to explain, but generally most you buy from a professional company like CLYW or Yoyofactory are great and they are transparent in the fact that generally the pricier they are, the better they are. All of my cheapest yoyos are the ones with the least spin time, hardest to control, worst balance etc. Other factors are rim design and colours. Certain designs limit you to certain tricks, such as being unable to balance it on your finger. I generally want a design which lets me do this. And then least importantly if its not a pretty colour...what's the point? A nice looking yoyo can make a trick just look a tiny bit nicer.",How do you determine if a D&D book or pdf will be useful in your games? Are there any specific elements or content you look for?,"I just see if it translates well. Additional weapon options, spells, subclasses, monsters etc. are easily fit in.
